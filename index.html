          <h1>AI-Powered Client Relation Manager Built for Personal Injury Law Firms</h1>
          <p>Amicus is the all-in-one case management platform designed specifically for plaintiff-side personal injury attorneys. Push cases forward faster, draft legal documents in seconds, and keep clients satisfied with automated updates—all from a single, intelligent platform that eliminates the need for clunky tech stacks and endless spreadsheets.</p>
          <p>From initial intake through settlement, Amicus centralizes every aspect of PI litigation: case tracking, deadline management, document generation, client communication, and file storage. Purpose-built around how personal injury firms actually work, not generic legal practice management.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Centralized Case Dashboard for Personal Injury Workflows</h2>
          <p>Track every active case with real-time visibility into stage progression, upcoming deadlines, and recent activity in one unified dashboard. No more jumping between apps or digging through spreadsheets to find case status. Filter by attorney, case stage, or priority level. Know which clients need updates at a glance. The case dashboard is customizable to match your firm's specific PI workflows—whether you handle motor vehicle accidents, slip and falls, medical malpractice, or premises liability. Estimated time saved: 8+ hours per week on case lookups and internal follow-ups.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>AI Document Drafting for Demand Letters, Complaints, and Motions</h2>
          <p>Generate first drafts of demand letters, complaints, and motions in seconds instead of hours. Amicus pulls case details automatically from your structured case information—plaintiff data, defendant information, incident facts, medical records, and damages calculations—then applies your firm's templates and formatting preferences. First drafts are generated in seconds, not hours, allowing your team to move straight to review and refinement rather than starting from a blank page. Consistent formatting across all documents. Estimated time saved: 2+ hours per document.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Automated Client Communication That Reduces Status Calls</h2>
          <p>Keep clients informed automatically when real case events happen. Amicus turns case activity into clear, plain-language updates delivered directly to clients through their secure portal. When you file a complaint, add medical records, or update case stage, clients receive notifications explaining what happened and what comes next. Clients can access key documents, review their case timeline, and message your team—all without needing to call the office for routine updates. Fewer interruptions from status calls means your team can focus on moving cases forward. Estimated reduction: 60% fewer routine status calls.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Purpose-Built for Plaintiff Personal Injury Litigation</h2>
          <p>Unlike generic legal practice management software, Amicus was designed from the ground up around the specific workflows, pain points, and demands of personal injury litigation. Customizable case pages let you add the data fields, contact types, and document categories your firm actually tracks—insurance adjusters, policy limits, medical providers, lien holders, expert witnesses. Structure cases to match real PI workflows, not force your practice into someone else's generic template. No implementation teams required. No extra fees for customization. The platform adapts to how your firm works.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Stop Duct-Taping Five Different Tools Together</h2>
          <p>One platform handles case management, file storage, client communication, task management, and document drafting. All case documents are organized automatically—upload once, access anywhere, share securely with clients. Assign tasks, set deadlines, and track progress without switching to separate project management tools. Have client updates sent automatically or communicate directly through Amicus. Less context-switching, less monthly software spend, less chaos. Move faster, work smarter, deliver a client experience that feels effortless.</p>
